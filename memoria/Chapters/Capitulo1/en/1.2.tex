\section{Objectives}
The main objective of this project is to develop an Android application that helps athletes to complement their physical activity, following a healthy and balanced diet to achieve the desired physical shape. It is also possible to interact with other athletes, creating diets that can be followed by other athletes or including comments and evaluations in them.

More specific objectives can be defined based on the main objective:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow an athlete to register in the application to discover and analyze all the diets in the application, and to update the weight and insert the daily steps, in order to keep a tally and visualize the progress in graphs.
    \item Allow athletes to follow a diet inserted from the application by any of the users, whether they are athletes or administrators.
    \item To offer the possibility to the athlete to evaluate the diet he/she is following, in order to help other athletes to decide and know which diets are being effective.
    \item Allow all athletes the ability to create one or more diets, detailing the foods that compose it, the recommended amount of each one of them and even publishing documentation that helps to follow the diet.
    \item Allow athletes to add foods to diets and have their nutritional information updated at all times.
\end{itemize}
